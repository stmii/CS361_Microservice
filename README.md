# CS361_Microservice
My Microservice for my CS361 Project

1. Clear instructions for how to REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call:

  To REQUEST a travel tip, simply write 'tip' to travel-tip-service.txt
  
  Example:
  Overwrite whatever is in travel-tip-service.txt to 'tip'
  
  Contents of travel-tip-service.txt should be: 'tip'
  
  (do not include quotation marks)

2. Clear instructions for how to RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented:

  To RECEIVE data from travel-tip, wait for 3 seconds after requesting, then read the contents of travel-tip-service.txt to a string.
  The contents of travel-tip-service.txt will be a travel tip in the form of a string (utf-8)!

3. UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data work:
